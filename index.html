          <p class="lead"> <em>Let BankOn San Francisco help you open an account today.</em>

        </div>
        <div class="span8">
          <p>
            Financially, a bank account changes everything. It&#8217;s a doorway to savings, and financial security. It offers protection from the high fees charged by check cashing companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bank On San Francisco makes it easy for you to get a bank account &#8211; even if you&#8217;ve had problems with an account in the past, have never had an account before, or are not a U.S citizen.
          </p>
        </div>

      <!-- WHY -->
      <div id="why" class="container">
        <hr>
        <p>
          By opening a bank account, you take a big step toward financial security. You can keep your money safe, enter the financial mainstream, and start saving for your dreams. The free- or low-cost accounts you get through Bank On make it easier than ever to start.
        </p>
        IT COSTS LESS THAN A CHECK-CASHING SERVICE
        <p>
          Check-cashing stores charge a steep fee for their service — anywhere from 2.5% to 10% of your monthly income. If you cash two paychecks a month, annual fees could cost you many times more than your own checking account. Also, money orders can cost up to $3 each, making it even more expensive just to get your own money.
        </p>
        IT'S SAFE
        <p>
          Without a bank account, you and your family face a greater risk of losing your money. You're more vulnerable to loss, robbery or theft. An earthquake, fire, or other disaster could leave you helpless. A checking or savings account is secure because your money is insured and protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
        </p>
        IT'S CONVENIENT
        <p>
          A checking account lets you deposit and withdraw your money whenever you want. You can pay bills with checks, on the Internet, or by direct debit, and avoid paying for money orders. You can use your debit card to buy things at stores or withdraw money from ATMs across the city, reducing the need to carry cash. You can also keep track of your spending on the Internet, by phone, or at the ATM. If you direct deposit your paycheck, you get instant access to your money. Best of all, this convenience comes at little or no cost.
        </p>
        IT HELPS YOU SAVE FOR THE FUTURE
        <p>
          If you don't have a bank account, it's harder to save money for long-term goals like buying a home, starting a business, or investing in education. Studies show that people with bank accounts are more likely to save, move up the economic ladder, and reach financial security.

      <!-- HOW -->
      <div id="how" class="container">

        </p>
        4. OPEN YOUR NEW ACCOUNT
        <p>
          Someone at the bank or credit union will walk you through the entire process. They can even connect you to free money management training classes to help you get the most from your new account.

So far, we've partnered with 14 banks and credit unions, with over 170 branches across San Francisco. Since we launched in 2006, we've helped over 10,000 San Franciscans each year to open bank accounts and enter the financial mainstream.When you partner with Bank On, you can expand your marketing in targeted low-income neighborhoods, identify new customers, develop strategies to reach unbanked customers, and make strong connections in the community.
